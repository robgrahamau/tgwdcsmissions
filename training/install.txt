In script_loader.lua you will see the following lines:
restarttime = "12pm"
restart = 6
usehypeman = true
password = "hahaha"
ADMINPASSWORD2 = "yeahright"

The restarttime is the time that your server restarts every day a 'sync' time.
the restart = 6 is the hours that your server has between restarts.
usehypeman = true/false - turn on/off the use of hypeman discord bot loading.
password - your main admin password.
ADMINPASSWORD2 - the password that lets you run 'Admin 2' level commands (in line script loading direct from a marker command).
